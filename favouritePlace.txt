Darjeeling is one of my favourite places I have visited so far. The views from Darjeeling are like a dream, especially when I watched the sunrise over the mountains.

It has many nice places to visit, like Peace Pagoda, tea gardens, and Ghum railway station(India's highest railway station, situated at an altitude of 2258 metres). Walking through the tea gardens was so peaceful, and it's a place where time feels like it slows down.
